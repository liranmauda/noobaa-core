# Ignore .sreq Files

Do **not** read, edit, or suggest changes to `.sreq` files.

`.sreq` files are signature test request fixtures (captured HTTP requests). They should be left unchanged by the agent unless the user explicitly asks to modify them.

When searching or refactoring, skip files matching `*.sreq` or `**/*.sreq`.
